## 📝 Process

Upon learning about lists and dictionaries in Python, I had the idea of creating some projects based on them.

So I created a program that will show users, multiple-choice questions and options from which they can choose answers.  If they answer it correctly, their score will be incremented, and if they answer wrong, their score will be decreased. The answer key and their result percentage will be given to the user after the test.
